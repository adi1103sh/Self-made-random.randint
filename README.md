# Self-made-random.randint
Tried to make random.randint() without using random module.
Made use of current time that changes every second and hence gives different output
everytime.
LIMITATION: While passing arguments argument1 should be greater than argument2 i.e. (45,67) or (-84,-45)
            Do not pass floating point decimals as arguments, it works only on integers.
